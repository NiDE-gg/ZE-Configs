# Stripper containing bug fixes for ze_night_cinema_a4_3 (01/28/2023)

;-------------------------------------------------
; Avoid triggering repeat killer in Willy stage after Ozzie sequence
;
; When the zombie with item dies, there are 2 events:
;  - The targetname is cleared so the ZM no longer is marked as boss
;  - The zombie is teleported back to the stage
; Due to simulteneous events, the ZM gets TP-ed back before its targetname is cleared
; Then, the hurt trigger kills that player again, leading to repeat killer
; Disable the boss-filtered TP to humans before the kill trigger is enabled
